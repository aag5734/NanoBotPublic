# NanoBot

## Overview 

This is a bot that I made as a response to hearing one of my friends playing a game 
I wasn't really fond of.

NanoBot looks through the game activity of whatever server they're in and detects what 
I think is a "cringe" game. Nano will dm the user giving them a fair warning for next time.

This is really the only thing that the bot can do at this time but I'll probably have it do some
useful stuff in the future. For now it just calls you cringe. Make of it what you will :P

## Getting Started

If this is your first time making a bot for Discord, you would want to start by installing a couple things

Start by installing **Node** (specifically v16). You can install it from here: `https://nodejs.org/en/download/`

Next, create the directory where you want your bot to reside in and run `npm install` in the same directory.

Finally, install the **Discord.JS** by running the following command in the same directory `npm i discord.js`

From here, you can paste the index.js file that contains the code we care about and replace the placeholder 
token with your own bot's token.

**NOTE**
**If you're planning on making a repo with your token in your index file, make sure to set it to 'private'**

You now have a bot!....kinda. There are tons of videos on how you can host the bot in your server and run it,
I reccomend watching this video:
